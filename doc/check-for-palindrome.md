## Check for Palindrome

Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was recently asked by Microsoft:

Given a string, determine if there is a way to arrange the string such that the string is a palindrome. 
If such arrangement exists, return a palindrome (There could be many arrangements). 
Otherwise, return None.

Here's some starter code:

```python
def find_palindrome(s):
    # Fill this in.

print(find_palindrome('momom'))
# momom
```
